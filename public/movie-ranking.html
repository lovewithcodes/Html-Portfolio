<h1>The Best Anime According to Abhishek</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Anime of all-time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>One piece</h3>
<p>The series brings to life a world filled with strange creatures and dastardly villains, most of whom possess extraordinary powers.</p>

<h3>Attack on titan</h3>
<p>The evolution of these characters has been nothing short of amazing, from the animation to the overall story arc.</p>

<h3>Death note</h3>
<p>Death Note stands apart from many other anime in the Shonen genre because it doesnâ€™t need to rely on fast-paced action scenes to keep the audience hooked.</p>
